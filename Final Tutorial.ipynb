    "The purpose of this project is to create a tutorial for someone learning how to go through the data science pipeline. This project will utilize data on NCAA Division I college basketball teams to try to predict a team's performance in the NCAA March Madness tournament. We will start off by analyzing team's statistics during the season, see which features appear to be the best at predicting a team's success in the postseason, and then we'll see if we're able to successfully predict a team's postseason ranking based on their performance during the season.

It's not surprising that a college basketball team's performance in March Madness can be predicted based on their performance during their season, but it is almost a little surprising that the models weren't even more accurate. That indicates that there might be a little bit more randomness in the tournament, or that certain teams may end up actually getting better or worse throughout the season.  \n",
